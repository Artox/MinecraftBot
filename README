MinecraftBot is a simple bot meant to integrate IRC and Minecraft chat.
It uses the PircBot API (http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php) to connect to and interact with IRC.

Features:

From Minecraft, it displays:
-Regular chat messages
-3rd person (/me) messages, which this plugin adds support for
-Players joining
-Players leaving
-Players being kicked
-Player death messages
-Server messages (console 'say' command)

From IRC, it displays:
-Normal messages
-3rd person (/me) messages
-Joins
-Parts (no part messages due to API limitation)
-Kicks
-Nick changes
-Quits

Before this plugin can be considered complete, it needs to
be good enough to use as a simple IRC client. This means adding:
-IRC colors to Minecraft
-Mode changes to Minecraft (not necessarily all but at least common ones, like op and voice)
-Topic changes to Minecraft
