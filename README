MinecraftBot is a simple bot meant to integrate IRC and Minecraft chat.
It uses the PircBot API (http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php) to connect to and interact with IRC.

List of features:

From Minecraft, it displays:
-Regular chat messages
-3rd person (/me) messages, which this plugin adds support for
-Players joining
-Players leaving
-Players being kicked
-Player death messages
-Server messages (console 'say' command)

From IRC, it displays:
-Normal messages
-3rd person (/me) messages
-Joins
-Parts (no part messages due to API limitation)
-Kicks
-Nick changes
-Common mode changes (op/deop, voice/devoice)
-Topic changes
-Quits

Commands available:
-!players in IRC
-/irc op and /irc deop (Permission: 'minecraftbot.op')
-/irc voice and /irc devoice (Permission: 'minecraftbot.voice')
-/irc kick (Permission

Before this plugin can be considered complete, it needs to be usable as a basic IRC client.
Features missing until it reaches v1.0:
-Passing IRC colors in messages to Minecraft
-Showing a few more mode changes
--More meaningful messages for some modes and a generic message for the rest ("user has set +mode")
-Some more /irc commands, maybe for nick changes
--Note: Can't do /irc ban due to an API limitation. No way to get a given user's hostmask.
