MinecraftBot is a simple bot meant to integrate IRC and Minecraft chat.
It uses the PircBot API (http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php) to connect to and interact with IRC.

The goal of this plugin is to stay simple.
This plugin is only capable of passing messages back and forth between Minecraft and IRC.

From Minecraft, it displays:
-Regular chat messages
-3rd person (/me) messages, which this plugin adds support for
-Players joining
-Players leaving
-Players being kicked
-Player death messages
-Server messages (console 'say' command)

From IRC, it displays:
-Normal messages
-3rd person (/me) messages
-Joins
-Parts (no part messages due to limitations)
-Kicks
-Nick changes
-Quits

Before this plugin can be good enough to be 1.0, it needs to
be good enough to use as a simple IRC client. This means adding:
-IRC colors to Minecraft
-Mode changes to Minecraft (not necessarily all but at least common ones, like op and voice)
-Topic changes to Minecraft

Misc features to add:
-Configuration
--Which messages to show
--What colors to use
