#MinecraftBot configuration
#This file was generated by the plugin and contains all the default values.
#Not all required values have been filled in, however. To use this plugin, you must at least add to the
#'server' and 'channel' values under the 'connection' section.

#Missing values are assumed to be either blank or false.

#It is possible to change the configuration values and apply them while the plugin is active.
#You may do so with the '/minecraftbot reload' command. Note that everything under 'connection'
#is ignored while the plugin is running. The plugin itself must be reloaded to get the new values.

connection:
#IRC connection settings
  #server: Required. The name of the IRC server. Example: irc.esper.net

settings:
#Some extra settings for better control of the bot
#More settings will appear here in future releases
  #ping_developer: Will satisfy the plugin developer's curiosity of how many servers are using this plugin.
  #It sends the version numbers for this plugin and the server it's running on. Nothing else.
  #***Info is not sent unless the config file is loaded and the bot is started.
  #***You have the chance to opt-out before any data is ever sent.
  ping_developer: true

  #those that have the 'minecraftbot.manage' permission.
  send_log_to_ops: true
  #quit_message: The quit message used when the bot quits IRC. Used only when the plugin is disabled.
  quit_message: ''

line_formatting:
#You may edit how each line sent by this plugin looks like.
#This plugin does not edit the chat formatting in Minecraft.

#You may enter either IRC or Minecraft color codes into any field.
#The color codes will be automatically translated to the appropriate format.
#List of Minecraft color codes: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_server_protocol#Color_Codes
#Replace the & with the section symbol: §
#Keep in mind that some text generated anywhere else may override the color codes you enter in these lines.

#Words that are surrounded by % signs may be used as variables. See the bottom of this file for more details.

#If a formatting line is blank, it is considered disabled and no message will be sent.

  #For messages sent to IRC from Minecraft
  to_irc:
    #server: Messages sent by the "say" console command
    server: '<*Server> %message%'
    chat:   '<%name%> %message%'
    #action: A /me message
    action: '* %name% %message%'
    join:   '§b* %name% has joined the game'
    leave:  '§b* %name% has left the game'
    kick:   '§c* %name% has been kicked (%reason%)'
    # The death message cannot be customized properly due to a limitation with Bukkit.
    # The entire death messages is represented as %message%. %name% is also available for this event.
    death:  '§c* %message%'
    
  #For messages sent to Minecraft from IRC
  to_minecraft:
    chat:   '#> <%name%> %message%'
    action: '#> * %name% %message%'
    join:   '#> §b* %name% has joined %channel%'
    # At the moment, part reasons can't be displayed
    part:   '#> §b* %name% has left %channel%'
    quit:   '#> §b* %name% has quit IRC (%reason%)'
    kick:   '#> §c* %kicker% has kicked %name% (%reason%§c)'
    nick_change:  '#> §b* %oldname% is now known as %name%'
    mode_change:  '#> §b* %name% set mode: %mode%'
    topic_change: '#> §b* %name% changed the topic to: §r%topic%'

#Some words surrounded by % signs are considered to be variables. When the lines are read by the
#plugin, the variables are replaced by some other value. The variables available per each line are different.
#The default line formatting values use all available variables for that specific line.
#
#There are some variables that are able to get data from other plugins:
#  %faction% - Factions: Player's faction tag, works in to_irc lines

#If you want more variables, feel free to send a request on the forums (or a pull request on github).
